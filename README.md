# HomeController Server

## What is HomeController?

HomeController can manage smart devices built with the [libhomecontroller](https://github.com/DisgustingBungHole94/libhomecontroller) library.

## Build Instructions

Coming soon...

## Certificates

You must provide certificates for the TLS server. By default, the
server will search for the certificates in the directory `cert`
at the project root. This can be changed by editing [conf/homecontroller.conf](https://github.com/DisgustingBungHole94/HomeController_server/blob/master/conf/homecontroller.conf).
The certificates can be self-signed or generated by a service
like LetsEncrypt.
